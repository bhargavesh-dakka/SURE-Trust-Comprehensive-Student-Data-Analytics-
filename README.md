### Methodology and Results

  #### Methods/Technology used:



##### Tools/Software used: 

Google Looker Studio:
Looker Studio might refer to a part of the Looker platform that's focused on data visualisation and dashboard creation. Looker Studio provides a user-friendly interface for designing and customising interactive dashboards and reports. Users can drag and drop visual elements, charts, and widgets onto the canvas to create compelling data visualisations without needing extensive coding knowledge. Looker Studio aims to make the process of creating data-driven visuals more accessible to users who might not be deeply technical.
Looker Studio provides features for data governance and control. Organisations can ensure that the right users have access to the right data while maintaining security and compliance.
Looker Studio supports collaboration by allowing users to share dashboards, reports, and insights with team members. This facilitates better communication and alignment across departments.Looker Studio can connect to multiple data sources and create a centralised repository for data analysis. This reduces the need for manual data extraction and manipulation.


Spreadsheets: Google Sheets is a cloud-based application, which means you can access your spreadsheets from any device with an internet connection. This makes it easy to work on your spreadsheets from different locations and collaborate with others in real-time.Collaborative Editing: One of the standout features of Google Sheets is its real-time collaborative editing. Multiple users can work on the same spreadsheet simultaneously, and changes are automatically saved and synced for all users. You can also leave comments and suggestions.
Google Sheets includes a wide range of functions and formulas that allow you to perform complex calculations and data analysis. It supports most Excel functions.You can control who has access to your Google Sheets and what level of access they have (view, edit, comment).

Python : Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.
Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.
